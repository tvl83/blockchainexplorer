### Setup
Clone the repository and run npm install.

I recommend using nodemon which you can install with `npm i nodemon -g`

I also use tmux so that I can have one window split and run multiple processes

`sudo apt-get install tmux`

with tmux install you can type `tmux` and it'll look like the same console but it's a separate process. You can use `ctrl+b, "` to split the window horizontally.

use `ctrl+b, %` to split the pane vertically.

I usually split it horizontal then make sure I am in the bottom pane and split it vertically.

You can use `ctrl+b` and the directional arrows to navigate to different panes.

Tmux is pretty awesome to allow multiple things running in a single view.

mongodb needs to be installed as well. I recomment following https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-mongodb-on-ubuntu-16-04

After everything is set up be sure to change all the information in `config.json` to your own settings.

##### Sept 28, 2017 Notes

 Right now the major problem is with getting the information from the wallet to the db.

 You can see how I am doing it in the `import.json` file

 I have several commands set up using the `optimist` npm package to allow commandline arguments.

 To just save blocks and ALL required information for those blocks run
 `node import.js --cmd=saveblocks --start=1 --count=250` Right now 250 is a safe amount to run initially. You simply cannot run the entire blockchain in one go.

 After that's all complete you can run

 `node import.js --cmd=calculateaddressbalances` which will go through each address and update their balances and rank and save it to the database.

 I am currently trying to make it a 2-step process. First read in from the iond the blocks and transactions. I can easily run 500 or so in a single command and then with the command I can continue at 501 to get another chunk of 500.

 I think the limiting factor is running so many commands against the iond, so quickly. It's just in a loop and it can be run extremely fast. Also remember that for each 500 blocks there are 500+ transactions so it's doing 1000+ calls on the iond very quickly.

 I routinely get socket hangup errors and have to restart the iond.

 To try the two step process run `node import --cmd=saveblocksonly --count=500`

 the second step is `node import --cmd=pavv --end=500` would run from 1 to 500 if you run less than there are blocks/txs you can run pavv (pavv = **P**rocess**A**ddress**V**outs**V**ins) with a `--start=2` argument. With anything greater than 1 for the start argument it looks at the very last vin in the db and adds 1 and starts from there.

 What I am finding out is that if I have 500 blocks/txs and then do pavv `--end=100` then `--start=2 --end=200` it is doubling the data on the first 100 transactions instead of skipping them for some reason.
