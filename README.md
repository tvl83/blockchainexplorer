### Setup
Clone the repository and run npm install.

I recommend using nodemon which you can install with `npm i nodemon -g`

I also use tmux so that I can have one window split and run multiple processes

`sudo apt-get install tmux`

with tmux install you can type `tmux` and it'll look like the same console but it's a separate process. You can use `ctrl+b, "` to split the window horizontally.

use `ctrl+b, %` to split the pane vertically.

I usually split it horizontal then make sure I am in the bottom pane and split it vertically.

You can use `ctrl+b` and the directional arrows to navigate to different panes.

Tmux is pretty awesome to allow multiple things running in a single view.

mongodb needs to be installed as well. I recomment following https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-mongodb-on-ubuntu-16-04

After everything is set up be sure to change all the information in `config.json` to your own settings.

##### Sept 28, 2017 Notes

 Right now the major problem is with getting the information from the wallet to the db.

 You can see how I am doing it in the `import.json` file

 I have several commands set up using the `optimist` npm package to allow commandline arguments.

 To just save blocks and ALL required information for those blocks run
 `node import.js --cmd=saveblocks --start=1 --count=250` Right now 250 is a safe amount to run initially. You simply cannot run the entire blockchain in one go.

 After that's all complete you can run

 `node import.js --cmd=calculateaddressbalances` which will go through each address and update their balances and rank and save it to the database.

 I am currently trying to make it a 2-step process. First read in from the iond the blocks and transactions. I can easily run 500 or so in a single command and then with the command I can continue at 501 to get another chunk of 500.

 I think the limiting factor is running so many commands against the iond, so quickly. It's just in a loop and it can be run extremely fast. Also remember that for each 500 blocks there are 500+ transactions so it's doing 1000+ calls on the iond very quickly.

 I routinely get socket hangup errors and have to restart the iond.

 To try the two step process run `node import --cmd=saveblocksonly --count=500`

 the second step is `node import --cmd=pavv --end=500` would run from 1 to 500 if you run less than there are blocks/txs you can run pavv (pavv = **P**rocess**A**ddress**V**outs**V**ins) with a `--start=2` argument. With anything greater than 1 for the start argument it looks at the very last vin in the db and adds 1 and starts from there.

 What I am finding out is that if I have 500 blocks/txs and then do pavv `--end=100` then `--start=2 --end=200` it is doubling the data on the first 100 transactions instead of skipping them for some reason.

### Oct 1, 2017 Notes

Successfully sync'd 2000 blocks. It took a while but it is done and extremely accurate.

Working on a script to go through little by little and sync all the blocks. I am also going to backup the db at regular intervals as well.

The file `ToBlock2000full.archive` is a mongodump archive of the current database up to block 2000. More will be provided at a regular interval.

created crontab entries:

```
*/5 * * * * /home/ionnode/.nvm/versions/node/v7.10.1/bin/node /home/ionnode/explorer/import.js --cmd=getpeerinfo >> /home/ionnode/import-peerinfo.log 2>&1
*/9 * * * * /home/ionnode/.nvm/versions/node/v7.10.1/bin/node /home/ionnode/explorer/import.js --cmd=saveblocksonly --count=200 >> /home/ionnode/import-saveblocksonly.log 2>&1
*/10 * * * * /home/ionnode/.nvm/versions/node/v7.10.1/bin/node /home/ionnode/explorer/import.js --cmd=pavv --start=2 --end=25 >> /home/ionnode/import-pavv.log 2>&1

```

- Running `getpeerinfo` every 5 minutes to update nodes. It automatically drops nodes that haven't been connected to within 24 hours.
- `saveblocksonly` is run every 9 minutes to give time for it timing out and such. I bumped it down from 250 to 200 because it was timing out at 250. Might need to go lower per run.
- `pavv` is the command, set at every 10 minutes but this needs to be adjusted or commented out  until the saveblocksonly is up to date.
- `calculateaddressbalances` is to be run every night at midnight (maybe this can be more frequent throughout the day). It currently does not auto quit the process so this needs to be fixed.

Added more archive files with more blocks to repo as a backup.

### Other Notes

With the API server running (`nodemon apiserver.js`) and `npm start` also running you need to run `http://<your IP here>:3001/ionmarketinfo?force=true` to gather the market info for the first time. It'll run again for every page request if the data is more than 5 minutes old.

## TODO

9/28/2017 source: https://github.com/ionomy/ion/wiki/ionomy-Bounty-Information
**Delivered options must include:** All historical block extraction information ( ~~Latest Blocks~~ , ~~block times~~, daily block count), ~~richlist~~, ~~active network/client/nodes~~, address tagging, inflation information.

- Daily block count is another part I still have to build and is pretty straight forward.
- Inflation information. I am not entirely sure how to calculate this information. I am pretty sure it's the rate at which coins are created.
- Address Tagging. This is already set up in the mongoose schema's and the functionality is built into the wallet. Creating the functions for this will be easy and quick. I cannot test it until the blockchain is up to date, though because I need to have an address that I own to be able to sign a message.

10/2/2017
- Use `node-ps` to detect if `iond` is running and if not, run it. This should be a cronjob running 1 minute before the import script

### Complete

- **Latest Blocks** are on the index page and one can visit the block by height and by hash
  - Transactions are also listed and linked to by hash
  - Addresses can be visited and viewed with `/address/<address>`
- **Block times** are included in the latest blocks list
- Balances are updated for a given address on the fly when new blocks affect a specific address. A `calculatebalances` function is ran every night to update **richlist** rankings
- **active network/client/nodes** list is available. It is similar to chainz and has information on the latest nodes that have connected to my node within the last 24 hours. Every 5 minutes it checks `getpeerinfo` and updates information in the database. After 24 hours if a given IP address is not updated it will be removed.
